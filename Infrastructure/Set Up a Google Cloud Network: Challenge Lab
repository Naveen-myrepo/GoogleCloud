Overview
In a challenge lab youâ€™re given a scenario and a set of tasks. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, you will use the skills learned from the labs in the course to figure out how to complete the tasks on your own! An automated scoring system (shown on this page) will provide feedback on whether you have completed your tasks correctly.

When you take a challenge lab, you will not be taught new Google Cloud concepts. You are expected to extend your learned skills, like changing default values and reading and researching error messages to fix your own mistakes.

To score 100% you must successfully complete all tasks within the time period!

This lab is recommended for students who have enrolled in the Set up a Google Cloud Network skill badge. Are you ready for the challenge?

Setup
Before you click the Start Lab button
Read these instructions. Labs are timed and you cannot pause them. The timer, which starts when you click Start Lab, shows how long Google Cloud resources will be made available to you.

This hands-on lab lets you do the lab activities yourself in a real cloud environment, not in a simulation or demo environment. It does so by giving you new, temporary credentials that you use to sign in and access Google Cloud for the duration of the lab.

To complete this lab, you need:

Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
Note: Use an Incognito or private browser window to run this lab. This prevents any conflicts between your personal account and the Student account, which may cause extra charges incurred to your personal account.
Time to complete the lab---remember, once you start, you cannot pause a lab.
Note: If you already have your own personal Google Cloud account or project, do not use it for this lab to avoid extra charges to your account.
Challenge scenario
You are tasked with setting up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and ensuring proper connectivity between virtual machines (VMs) in different subnets. You will also configure firewall rules to manage access and test network connectivity between the VMs.

As part of this challenge, you will need to create the following:

A VPC network with two subnetworks and firewalls need to be created to connect new resources together.
Launch two VMs in each subnet and verify that these machines can successfully communicate with each other using the protocols you've configured.

### Task 1: Create Networks

# Step 1: Create a VPC network
gcloud compute networks create network-name --subnet-mode=custom --bgp-routing-mode=regional

# Step 2: Create Subnet A
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-a-name \
    --network=network-name \
    --region=network-region-1 \
    --range=10.10.10.0/24 \
    --stack-type=IPV4_ONLY

# Step 3: Create Subnet B
gcloud compute networks subnets create subnet-b-name \
    --network=network-name \
    --region=network-region-2 \
    --range=10.10.20.0/24 \
    --stack-type=IPV4_ONLY

### Task 2: Add Firewall Rules

# Step 1: Firewall rule for SSH
gcloud compute firewall-rules create firewall-rule-1 \
    --network=network-name \
    --priority=1000 \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=tcp:22 \
    --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
    --target-tags=allow-ssh

# Step 2: Firewall rule for RDP
gcloud compute firewall-rules create firewall-rule-2 \
    --network=network-name \
    --priority=65535 \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=tcp:3389 \
    --source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 \
    --target-tags=allow-rdp

# Step 3: Firewall rule for ICMP
gcloud compute firewall-rules create firewall-rule-3 \
    --network=network-name \
    --priority=1000 \
    --direction=INGRESS \
    --action=ALLOW \
    --rules=icmp \
    --source-ranges=10.10.10.0/24,10.10.20.0/24 \
    --target-tags=allow-icmp

### Task 3: Add VMs to Your Network

# Step 1: Create VM in Subnet A
gcloud compute instances create us-test-01 \
    --zone=ZONE1 \
    --subnet=subnet-a-name \
    --tags=allow-ssh,allow-icmp

# Step 2: Create VM in Subnet B
gcloud compute instances create us-test-02 \
    --zone=ZONE2 \
    --subnet=subnet-b-name \
    --tags=allow-ssh,allow-icmp

### Verify Connectivity

To verify the connectivity using SSH and ICMP, follow these commands in the SSH terminal:

# SSH into us-test-01 VM
gcloud compute ssh us-test-01 --zone=ZONE1

# Inside the SSH session, ping us-test-02 VM
ping -c 3 <us-test-02-internal-ip-address>


To observe latency between instances:

ping -c 3 us-test-02.ZONE

Congratulations!
In this challenge lab you have shown that you know how to create a network, add subnets and virtual machines, and confirmed that the VMs can communicate with each other.
